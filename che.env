#
# Fundamental parameters that affect the initial system operation.
#
# Version  
#     Sets the version of Che to download and use. We respect this variable
#     during 'che init' and 'che download'. Once a Che instance has been
#     generated, CHE_VERSION is set in che.env, in the instance
#     folder and it locks the version for which Che is running. If you set 
#     CHE_VERSION to a value that is diferent from what is set in che.ver
#     Che will not start until this conflict is realized. Run 
#     `che version` to see all the versions available.
#CHE_VERSION=nightly

# IP address, hostname, or DNS  
#     The IP address or DNS name of where the Che endpoint will service your users.
#     If you are running this on a local system, we auto-detect this value as the IP
#     address of your Docker daemon. On many systems, especially those from cloud hosters
#     like DigitalOcean, you must explicitly set this to the external IP address or
#     DNS entry provided by the provider.
#CHE_HOST=localhost

# Production vs. Development Mode
#     Designates whether Che should run in production mode or development mode. 
#     Production mode activates overlay networking and other configurations needed 
#     for smoother operation at scale. Development mode simplifies the operation of 
#     Che on a single desktop, usually with an IP address that is internally 
#     available, but not externally available.
#CHE_ENVIRONMENT=development

# Configuration File Location
#     The location on your host where the Che configuration templates are loaded by the 
#     bootstrap initiator when you run `che init`. The `che.env` file is located here.
#     If you run `che init` in an empty directory and you have not set this variable in 
#     memory then it defaults to `$PWD/config`.
#CHE_CONFIG=

# Che Data Location
#     The location on your host where the Che instance configuration, data and logs
#     are stored. If you run `che init` in an empty directory and you have not set 
#     this variable in memory then it defaults to `$PWD/instance`.
#CHE_INSTANCE=

# Proxies
#     Che's internal system services such as its internal JVMs need to 
#     have system level properties applied so that they can reach the Internet. Che's 
#     system uses the Internet to communicate with DockerHub for downloading images that 
#     are used to run Che's systems. Note that you must configure proxy access in three
#     locations. First, you enabled your system Docker daemon to use proxies. Second, you 
#     configure proxies for Che's internal system services. Third, if you want your users 
#     to access the Internet, then you should also add proxy values for their workspaces.
#    
#     Please be mindful of the proxy URL formatting. Proxies are unforgiving if you do not type
#     the URL just right, inclduing the protocol and whether they allow a trailing /.
#CHE_HTTP_PROXY_FOR_CHE=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_HTTPS_PROXY_FOR_CHE=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_NO_PROXY_FOR_CHE=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# Proxies for Workspaces
#     The proxy values that will be set as environment variables within each user's workspace.
#     Set these to allow users Internet access if they are behind a proxy.
#CHE_HTTP_PROXY_FOR_CHE_WORKSPACES=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_HTTPS_PROXY_FOR_CHE_WORKSPACES=http://myproxy.com:8001/
#CHE_NO_PROXY_FOR_CHE_WORKSPACES=<ip-or-domains-that-do-not-require-proxy-access>

# Local Assembly
#     For developers of Che or those that are building custom extensions and plugins. 
#     If you are recompiling Che, this folder specifies where the Tomcat assembly is 
#     compiled on your local host. We will mount your local assembly into the Che 
#     container instead of using the binaries that are included within the container. 
#     This allows developers to work within Che's source repository while also running
#     Che as a set of containers. You should never set this value, and instead set 
#     `CHE_DEVELOPMENT_MODE=on` using the CLI and thens et `CHE_DEVELOPMENT_REPO` 
#     The CLI fills in this value for you.
#CHE_ASSEMBLY=

# XMX
#      Che's core server runs as a Tomcat application on top of a JVM. This sets the 
#      JVM XMX settings that are loaded by the JVM when the Che container boots. 
#      It should be rare that you would need to change this.
#CHE_SERVER_XMX=2048

# User workspaces have their own runtimes. Those runtimes can be composed 1..n containers.
# We call each container a 'machine' as it is a dedicated runtime. One of the machines for a
# workspace must be designated as the 'development' machine, which installs Che agents to 
# provide additional services to the user. These parameters configure how Che manages user
# machines and the agents that are deployed within them. 
#
# Since workspaces have their own runtimes, they have separate proxies that do not inherit from
# the system proxies that you have configured for your Docker daemon.
#
# /etc/hosts for Workspaces
#     This will add entries into the user's /etc/hosts file that is running within their workspace.
#     You may need to configure this file to give the user access to systems within your network
#     or access to the Internet.
#CHE_MACHINE_EXTRA_HOSTS=NULL

# Idle Timeout
#     The length of time that a user is idel with their workspace when the system will suspend the
#     workspace by snapshotting it and then stopping it. Idleness is determined by the length of
#     time that the user has not interacted with the workspace, meaning that one of our agents
#     has not received instructions. Leaving a browser window open counts as idleness time.
#CHE_MACHINE_WS_AGENT_INACTIVE_STOP_TIMEOUT_MS=600000

# Memory
#     The recommended RAM size that users will see for their workspace when they create new
#     workspaces in the user dashboard.
#CHE_MACHINE_DEFAULT_MEM_SIZE_MB=1024

# Memory Swap
#     Adjust machine swap memory by multiplication current machnine memory on provided value.
#     default is 0 which means disabled swap, if set multiplier value equal to 0.5 
#     machine swap will be configured with size that equal to half of current machine memory. 
#     It should be rare that you would configure this. See Docker memory swap online 
#     for background.
#CHE_MACHINE_DOCKER_MEMORY_SWAP_MULTIPLIER=0

# Host Volume Mounts
#     Semicolon separated list of volume mounts. If this is provided, Che will volume mount
#     those host folders into each workspace generated by your users. This is a way to allow
#     you to provide access to network attached storage that is shared across many workspaces.
#CHE_MACHINE_SERVER_EXTRA_VOLUME=/path/on/host:/path/in/workspace:ro,Z;/path/to/host2:/path/in/workspace2:ro,Z;

# Privilged Mode
#     Set to `true` if you would like user workspaces to be started with Docker's privileged mode.
#     Please be careful when setting this property. This allows user workspaces to gain access to 
#     the underly host with root privileges. However, privileged mode is needed if users want to
#     launch their own Docker containers from within their Docker-powered workspace.
#CHE_MACHINE_DOCKER_PRIVILEGE_MODE=false

# Agent Start Timeout
#     The length of time that a workspace will be allowed to boot before the system terminates the
#     boot process. If the Che container cannot establish two way communications with the 
#     agents within the workspace when it boots, then the workspace will not be started. 
#CHE_MACHINE_WS_AGENT_MAX_START_TIME_MS=300000
